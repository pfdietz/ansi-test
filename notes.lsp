(defnote :allow-nil-arrays
  "Allow specialized arrays of type (array nil).")

  "Allow specialized vectors of type (vector nil) of nonzero size.")

(defnote :nil-vectors-are-strings
  "Assume that (VECTOR NIL) objects are strings.")

(defnote :standardized-package-nicknames
  "The standardized package nicknames specified in section 11 of ANSI CL are exclusive (disputed).")

  "Interpret requirement 1.a on the TYPE-OF page to apply to all built-in types that
contain the object, not just to some builtin type that contains the object.")

  "Disable the test if gray streams are present.")

  "The spec says MAKE-CONDITION should work on any subtype of CONDITION, but this causes all sorts of problems.  They probably meant only non-compound names.")

  "The definition of similarity implies that -0.0 and 0.0 are similar (for each float type.)
If negative zeros are distinct this is probably not good, since it makes (defconstant x 0.0) be nonportable.")

  "Assume that (for sequence functions MAP, etc.) the element type of a vector result type
